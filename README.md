# Operating system kernel
A small, fully functional operating system kernel for the RISC V computer architecture. The operating system is multithreaded and supports time sharing. The kernel is capable of memory allocation and thread management. It supports semaphores, time sharing, synchronous and asynchronous context switches, and preemption due to an interrupt caused by a timer or a keyboard.

NOTE: To be added in the future, as university's rules don't allow me to post the code as of writing this.
